Setup CF (Cloud Foundry)

** UPDATE ** Probably the easiest way is PCF Dev https://pivotal.io/pcf-dev BOSH Lite gives you more options, but for most people just trying out CF I would recommend PCF Dev.

Easiest way is to deploy CF using BOSH Lite. You will probably need 16gb of ram.

Install Vagrant

gem install vagrant
Download BOSH Lite

git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite
Start up BOSH Lite

cd bosh-lite
vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
Target Bosh Lite

bosh target 192.168.50.4 lite
username/password: admin/admin

Add needed routes

bin/add-route
Download the Stemcell

wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-warden-stemcells/bosh-stemcell-3147-warden-boshlite-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz
Install BOSH CLI

gem install bosh_cli --no-ri --no-rdoc
Upload the stemcell that BOSH Lite CF uses

bosh upload stemcell bosh-stemcell-3147-warden-boshlite-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz
Download CF

git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release.git --recursive
Generate the CF BOSH Lite manifest

scripts/generate-bosh-lite-dev-manifest
Create, Upload and Deploy release

bosh create release --force && bosh upload release && bosh -n deploy
^^^ This will take awhile ^^^

Work with CF

Install CF CLI
See instructions here:
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli

Login to CF

cf login -a https://api.bosh-lite.com --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin
Create an org

cf create-org org
Create a space

cf create-space space -o org
Target org and space

cf target -o org -s space
Push App

cf push
That should do it!
